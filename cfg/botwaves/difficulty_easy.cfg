// ============================================================
// BotWaves - Easy Difficulty Configuration
// ============================================================
// Bots use difficulty level 1 (passive - they don't shoot).
//
// NOTE: By default, the plugin also strips weapons from bots
// in Easy mode, leaving them with only a knife. This behavior
// is controlled by the "StripWeaponsOnEasyMode" setting in the
// plugin's JSON config file. Set it to false if you want bots
// to keep their weapons (they still won't shoot).
